Things that need to be Corrected: 

- If you ask for 10, it takes the first character. So, it will display as 1.  

- Please only enter the rank that you find in your hand. 
It doesn't check what you have entered is in your hand.


Bugs
- When a player contains more than one card of the same rank, it will remove one card. 
Other times it will remove all the cards.

- If a player has 4 cards of the same rank, it doesn't remove from the arraylist and increment the score.
- scoring doesn't work properly

- Sometimes exception error is thrown when player runs out of cards
